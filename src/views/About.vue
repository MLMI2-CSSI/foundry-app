      We make using and sharing ML models and datasets easy.
    </h2>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Foundry simplifies your workflow by hosting large interpretable
        datasets and ready-to-use models. We remove common barriers for
        using machine learning so you can get right to work on your
        research. Reproducing models and using large datasets has never
        been easier.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Community</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to connect like-minded people to drive research forward.
        Whether you're a scientist who would like to use machine learning
        but doesn't know where to start, or a software engineer looking to
        apply your machine learning knowledge, we have a space for you in
        our community.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        Sharing data and models is more important now than ever. As the
        reproducibility crisis in science continues to limit research, we
        see Foundry as the ultimate collaborative tool to combat it. We
        host large datasets that can be loaded from anywhere and models
        that are run on our service so there are no computing power
        requirements for you.
