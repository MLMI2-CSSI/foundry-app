## Resources
We're using [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) to build our app.

Use their [components](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/alerts/) as much as possible to simplify development as well as standardize our design across the app. 

Familiarize yourself with their [grid system](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/grids/) to create and edit existing layouts.

Vuetify has [Material Design Icons (MDI)](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/6.9.96/) built in. Please use these when you need icons.

It also has [color classes](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/styles/colors/#classes) built in. Use these to keep our colors consistent.

## References
We have the [original user flows miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lMbQDMo=/) and the [archived web app](https://github.com/MLMI2-CSSI/MLMI2-CSSI.github.io) from Summer 2021 to reference for design, functionality, and copy.
